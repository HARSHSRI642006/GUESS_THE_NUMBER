**Features**
: Random Number Generation: The game generates a random number between 1 and 100.
: Difficulty Levels: Choose between 'easy' (10 attempts) or 'hard' (5 attempts).
: User Input: Provide guesses until you guess the number correctly or run out of attempts.
: Feedback: The game provides feedback on whether your guess is too high or too low.
: Game Over: The game notifies you if you've run out of attempts or if you guessed the number: correctly.
